/**
 * This particle system extends the base ParticleSystem class, and I reccommend you look at some of the implementation, 
 * at least for the default setParticleAnimation()
 * 
 * You'll just be handling the tweens for each particle for their animation, overriding the base implementation.
 * 
 * The new particle animation add these behaviors, along with the existing setParticleAnimation behaviors:
 * 
 *  - Each particle should look like they're affected by gravity, accelerating down over the course of their lifetime. This
 *  change should also be affected by the particle's mass, meaning particles with a higher mass should fall faster.
 * 
 *  - Each particle should disappear over it's lifetime, moving from an alpha of 1 to 0.
